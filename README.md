Out of date readme lol

My tweeks for Anime Music Quiz

* Logs results into the chat
* Toggle between answer input and chat with `tab`
* When in a game lobby, `ctrl + enter` will press the "main button" (Start, Join, Ready)
* Toggle 'skip' with `ctrl + enter`
* Clear answer with `ctrl + /`

Does not select first thing in the dropdown :( `shift + enter` in the future? 

Tested with firefox. **Expect this readme to be out of date.**
